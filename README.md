# Spotigo
411 Project: Topic - Creating Playlists for Trip Durations
Members: Andrew Hu, Min Sung (Milo) Park, Kathlyn Sinaga, James Xiao

The official branch for this project is spotify-branch NOT main.
We had some issues storing our code in a folder called prototype so our prototype code is in the folder named "spotigo"

Installation & Setup Instructions:
1) Make sure you have node installed
2) Go into the spotigo directory and type in the command line "npm install". This should install all the dependencies
3) Create a .env file in the spotigo/backend and assign GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY your API key from google developer console
4) In the backend folder run "node server.js"
5) In the spotigo folder run "npm start"
