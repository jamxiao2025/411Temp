As a MusicGo user, I want to be able to input my destination into the app so that I can receive a playlist that matches the length of my travel time.
When I open the MusicGo app, I should see a field where I can enter my destination, either by typing in an address or selecting it from a map. The app should also give me the option to choose my mode of transportation (e.g. car, public transit, walking) so that it can accurately estimate my travel time.
If I enter a new destination while a playlist is already playing, the app should automatically generate a new playlist that matches the estimated travel time to my new destination. If I decide to cancel my journey or change my destination, the app should allow me to easily reset or update my travel information.
The app should also provide me with information about my estimated travel time, including any potential delays or disruptions that might affect my journey. If there are any changes to my travel time during my journey, such as unexpected traffic or route changes, the app should adjust the playlist accordingly to ensure that it continues to match my estimated travel time.
