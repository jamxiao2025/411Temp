As someone who likes routine, I like to listen to the same songs for weeks at a time when I find something I really like. I also go through the same routes at around the same time, so my travel time is usually the same. I want to be able to save playlists previously made and the option to loop songs. If the playlist I saved is too long or too short, it should be able to adjust the queue as it would with a newly generated playlist, but these changes should not affect the playlist I saved.
