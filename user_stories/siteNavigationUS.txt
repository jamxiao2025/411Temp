As a MusicGo user, I want to be able to easily navigate the site and find the features I need. When I open the MusicGo website, the homepage should provide clear navigation options for different sections of the site, such as "playlists," "radio stations," "music recommendations," and "settings." Each section should have a clear icon or label to help me quickly identify what I'm looking for. If I want to search for a specific song or artist, the website should have a search bar prominently displayed at the top of the page. The search bar should provide suggestions as I type, so that I can quickly find what I'm looking for. If I'm browsing through playlists or radio stations, the website should allow me to filter my search results by genre, mood, or popularity. The website should also allow me to sort my search results by name, date, or popularity, depending on my preference. If I want to create a new playlist or radio station, the website should have a clear button or link that takes me to a page where I can create my content. The website should also allow me to edit my existing playlists or radio stations, add new songs or stations, or delete content that I no longer want. Overall, the MusicGo website should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear labels and buttons that help me find what I'm looking for quickly and easily.
