As a MusicGo user, I want to be able to collaborate on playlists with my friends and family. When I open the MusicGo app, I should be able to create a shared playlist that I can invite others to contribute to. The app should allow me to send invitations to my friends and family members, either through email or through the app's messaging system. Once someone has accepted my invitation, they should be able to add songs to the shared playlist, either from their own music library or by searching for new songs within the app. The app should also allow me to set permissions for the shared playlist, such as whether or not other users can delete or rearrange songs. If someone adds a new song to the shared playlist, the app should notify me and other users so that we can listen to the new addition. If someone deletes a song, the app should also notify all users and keep a record of the deleted song in case anyone wants to add it back in. The shared playlist should also be accessible to all users at all times, so that anyone can listen to it even when they are not contributing to it. If I want to remove someone from the shared playlist, the app should allow me to do so easily without affecting the playlist itself.
