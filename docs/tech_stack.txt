The tech stack that we are using consists of React.js, Firebase, and Node.js
We decided to use React.js for our frontend because its what we're most comfortable with.
We decided to use Firebase to handle user CRUD operations. Since Firebase is a BAAS, it comes with functions that support OAuth and other user authorization protocls.
We decided to use Node.js to handle our API calls to Google Maps DistanceMatrix API and Spotify API.
